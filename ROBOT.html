							<p>This project had a few requirements:</p>
							<p>1.) The Robot must contain no less than 6 legs and no more than 10 legs.</p>
							<p>2.) The Robot must be no larger than 1 cubic foot.</p>
							<p>3.) The Robot must not cost more than $100 to produce.</p>
							<p>4.) The Robot will compete against other student's robots in both speed and agility.</p>
							<p>5.) The presentation should try to sell the robot as a viable product which solves a consumer demand.</p>

							<p>My robot was constructed for less than $40, beat all other student's robots in the competition for speed, and came in 2nd on agility, having successfully traversed a small obstacle course. Where most students focused on intricate and elaborate designs, I focused more on a simple yet effective design. I tried to minimize weight, wherever possible, and chose a linkage design that was simple but long tested. On the day of the competition, there were 2 robots that did not even function because they were overly complicated and the students did not have time to properly test and evaluate their design.</p>
							<p>While my robot may not have been the prettiest or the coolest, it was definitely the most effective. This project helped to reinforce the primary function of an engineer: to make a design efficient. Efficient in all aspects, from cost to energy usage.</p>
